## Project Plan
```
Here’s a **simple and clear project plan** for the **Pump Bot for Telegram** based on your requirements. The plan is divided into **main tasks** and **technical considerations** to ensure smooth execution.

---

## **Project Plan: Pump Bot for Telegram**

### **Phase 1: Project Setup**
1. **Task 1: Set Up Hosting Environment**
   - Create a HostGator account (if not already done).
   - Set up a shared hosting environment with PHP support.
   - Install necessary PHP libraries and dependencies (e.g., cURL, JSON).

2. **Task 2: Initialize Git Repository**
   - Create a Git repository for version control.
   - Set up a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files (e.g., `vendor/`, `.env`).

3. **Task 3: Configure Telegram Bot**
   - Create a new bot using **BotFather** on Telegram.
   - Obtain the bot token and store it securely.

---

### **Phase 2: Backend Development**
1. **Task 4: Develop PHP Backend**
   - Create a PHP script to handle Telegram bot commands.
   - Use the **Telegram Bot API** for communication.
   - Implement a basic command handler for `/start`, `/help`, etc.

2. **Task 5: Wallet Integration**
   - Integrate **Phantom Wallet API** for Solana.
   - Implement a generic wallet connection system to support other wallets.
   - Use secure methods for handling wallet connections (e.g., OAuth, API keys).

3. **Task 6: Token Pumping Logic**
   - Develop logic to allow users to select tokens and pumping durations.
   - Implement predefined durations (10 minutes, 1 hour, etc.).
   - Allow custom durations with input validation.

4. **Task 7: Gas Fee Settings**
   - Implement gas fee presets (Minimum, Fast, Turbo).
   - Dynamically calculate gas fees based on network conditions.
   - Store gas fee settings in a database or session.

5. **Task 8: On/Off Control**
   - Add functionality to turn the bot on/off.
   - Store the bot’s state (on/off) in a database or session.

---

### **Phase 3: Frontend Development**
1. **Task 9: Telegram Bot Interface**
   - Design a user-friendly command structure:
     - `/connectwallet` - Connect a wallet.
     - `/selecttoken` - Choose a token to pump.
     - `/setduration` - Set pumping duration.
     - `/setgasfee` - Set gas fee preset.
     - `/startpump` - Start the bot.
     - `/stoppump` - Stop the bot.
   - Provide clear feedback for each action.

2. **Task 10: Error Handling**
   - Implement error messages for invalid inputs or failed actions.
   - Log errors for debugging purposes.

---

### **Phase 4: Security and Testing**
1. **Task 11: Security Measures**
   - Use HTTPS for secure communication.
   - Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., wallet credentials).
   - Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.

2. **Task 12: Testing**
   - Test wallet integration with Phantom and other wallets.
   - Test token pumping logic with dummy tokens.
   - Test gas fee settings and on/off functionality.
   - Perform stress testing to ensure HostGator compatibility.

---

### **Phase 5: Deployment and Maintenance**
1. **Task 13: Deploy to HostGator**
   - Upload the PHP scripts and dependencies to HostGator.
   - Configure the server to run the bot continuously (e.g., using cron jobs).

2. **Task 14: Monitor and Maintain**
   - Monitor bot performance and uptime.
   - Address user feedback and fix bugs.
   - Plan for future updates (e.g., adding new wallets or tokens).

---

## **Technical Considerations**
1. **Hosting Constraints**:
   - Ensure PHP scripts are optimized for HostGator’s shared hosting (e.g., avoid long-running scripts).
   - Use lightweight libraries to minimize memory usage.

2. **Blockchain Integration**:
   - Use **Solana Web3.js** for Phantom wallet integration.
   - Research APIs for other wallets (e.g., MetaMask for Ethereum).

3. **Database**:
   - Use a simple database (e.g., MySQL) to store user preferences and bot states.
   - Avoid storing sensitive data like private keys.

4. **Scalability**:
   - Design the bot to handle multiple users simultaneously.
   - Use caching mechanisms to reduce server load.

5. **Compliance**:
   - Ensure compliance with blockchain and wallet API terms of service.
   - Follow Telegram’s bot development guidelines.
